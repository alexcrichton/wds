 <h1>Gift Giving</h1>
<dl>
  <dt>For the Bride and Groom</dt>
  <dd>  Because we will be relocating to Oregon later this year, no gifts (especially large bulky gifts)
        are necessary. We are not registered at any stores. Small gifts, checks, and cash are welcome (no gift cards please), but again,
        your attendance at our wedding is the gift we truly appreciate the most.</dd>
  <dt>Charitable Donations</dt>
  <dd> The bride is passionate about philanthrophy and volunteering.
   We would like to spread the happiness at our wedding to those in need.
   If you intend on giving us a monetary gift and would like to help us pay it forward,
   we would be happy to donate a portion of your gift to a charity of your choice. <strong>This is entirely optional</strong>, and you certainly should not feel obligated to participate.
   We would still appreciate your gift in its entirety to help pay for our wedding and moving expenses.
 </br></br>

 If you would like to make a donation, please specify the name of a charity and the donation amount
  on the back of the gift envelope. If you are unsure of what charity to choose,
then the bride readily suggests that you consider her two favorite animal shelters,
  Animal Rescue League of Iowa (ARL) and Furry Friends Refuge.
The bride has a cat named Lana that she adopted from Furry Friends.
  Lana is currently living happily at the home of the bride's parents along with Mai,
  a cat the bride's parents adopted from the ARL when the bride left the home to attend college out of state.
  The wedding couple also adopted one of their two spoiled dogs, Muffin, from the ARL.
